# binarySearch
Modify the binarySearch function presented in this chapter so it searches an array of strings instead of an array of ints. Test the function with a driver program.  Use the code in the attached file as a skeleton for the driver program.  This code also contains the word list which the function will search; the words are listed in alphabetical order.
